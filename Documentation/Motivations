I modelled a lot of the gameplay on how a dragon simulator would be
Motivation of a dragon
-Accrue hoard
-Steal princesses

So the gameplay must revolve around those 2 main motivations

Wording is important to give sense of scale, archaicness, monstrosity etc.
A dragon does not sleep, it slumbers
A dragon does not have inventory, it has a hoard

Consequences of main motivation
-Rescuing knights
-Treasure thieves
-Rival dragons
-Tributes from terrorised villages

A dragon is also wild 
consequences:
-Cannot talk
-Has no need for traditional rpg currency(gold)
-Magic must not have an acedmic conotation but something more wild, controllable?

On Magic:
-Magic is completely prepatory, no passive mana gen
-Get from rituals/items/people
-Magic must therefore be very strong since the barrier to cast one is immense
-Magic must also have wyrd consequences/be unpredictable since in this case it is not the application of careful craft but more instinctual and wild.
